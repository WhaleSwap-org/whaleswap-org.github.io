**Privacy Policy**

We prioritize user privacy in our open-source DeFi app. As developers, we do not collect, store, or share any personal user data, including IP addresses, wallet details, or transaction information. Our project is designed to minimize data handling entirely.

## Data We Do Not Collect

* No user information is hosted, logged, or processed on our end.
* We have no access to or control over individual user data from app usage.
* Wallet addresses and transactions occur solely on public blockchains, where they are recorded immutably by the decentralized ledger itself—we neither query nor retain this data for any purpose.

## Third-Party Services and Limitations

* **Public RPC Servers** : The app relies on third-party public RPC endpoints (e.g., Infura, Alchemy). These providers may log request metadata like IP addresses, timestamps, RPC methods, and wallet addresses involved in queries. We have no control over their logging practices.
* **GitHub Pages (Whale Swap Page)** : Our Whale Swap page is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub logs visitor IP addresses, timestamps, and request details for security and abuse prevention. As an open-source project, we cannot access, view, or manage these logs—GitHub retains full control.
* **Self-Hosting Option** : Users can self-host the app or components (e.g., via Docker or local nodes). In such cases, you control your own RPC and hosting logs entirely.

## No Sharing or Business Use

We will not share any user-related information with third parties. At this time, we do not use blockchain or app-derived data for business, marketing, or analytical purposes. Note that public blockchain activity is inherently visible to anyone querying the ledger.
