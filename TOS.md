**WhaleSwap Terms of Service**

**Last modified: Feb 23 2026**

These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the WhaleSwap open-source interface and software (the “Service” or “WhaleSwap”). WhaleSwap is a decentralized, community-driven project and is not a company, corporation, or legal entity. The Service provides a permissionless, non-custodial Over-The-Counter (OTC) swap interface for ERC-20 tokens.

You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Service. By accessing or using WhaleSwap, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Service.

**1. Nature of the Service**

**1.1 Decentralized and Open Source**
WhaleSwap is open-source software operated entirely on-chain via smart contracts. It is not based in, nor does it operate from, any specific country or jurisdiction. **You may fork the UI repo and run it on your own server or GitHub pages. There is no dependency on this GitHub Pages site.** The code is provided "as is" for use by the general public. There is no central authority or operator controlling the transactions you execute.

**1.2 OTC Swaps and Supported Networks**
The Service facilitates peer-to-peer or smart contract-mediated OTC swaps of digital assets. **The Service currently supports ERC-20 tokens on selected EVM compatible networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain.** You acknowledge that you are interacting directly with the smart contracts and the underlying blockchain networks, not with a centralized service provider.

**1.3 No Fees**
WhaleSwap does not charge any service fees, trading fees, or commissions. The protocol is free to use. However, you are solely responsible for paying any network transaction fees (gas fees) required by the networks to execute your transactions. WhaleSwap does not control, receive, or refund these network fees.

**2. Your Responsibilities and Compliance**

**2.1 User Responsibility**
You are solely responsible for your use of the Service. Because WhaleSwap is decentralized and stateless, we do not screen users or perform Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks. You further agree that your use of the Service complies with all local laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, including tax obligations.

**2.2 Wallet Security**
To use the Service, you must connect a non-custodial wallet. You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet, private keys, and seed phrases. WhaleSwap cannot access your wallet, recover your keys, or reverse transactions. If you lose access to your wallet, your assets may be lost permanently.

**2.3 Prohibited Uses**
You agree not to use the Service for any illegal purpose, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or the sale of illegal goods. While WhaleSwap does not monitor or censor transactions, engaging in illegal activities is a violation of this Agreement and may result in you being banned from using the frontend interface (though we cannot stop you from interacting with the smart contracts directly).

**3. Assumption of Risk and Disclaimers**

**3.1 Assumption of Risk**
BY ACCESSING AND USING WHALESWAP, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE FINANCIALLY AND TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:

* **Smart Contract Risk:** Smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of funds.
* **Network Risks:** You are using public EVM networks. We are not responsible for network congestion, high gas fees, or failures of the underlying blockchains.
* **Asset Risk:** Anyone can create a token, including fraudulent tokens. You are responsible for verifying the authenticity and contract address of any token you wish to swap.

**3.2 No Warranties**
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE INTERFACE.

**3.3 No Financial Advice**
WhaleSwap provides no investment, financial, tax, or legal advice. The information displayed on the interface is for informational purposes only. You should consult your own advisors before engaging in any digital asset transactions.

**4. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification**

**4.1 Waiver of Liability**
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WHALESWAP, ITS DEVELOPERS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANY AFFILIATED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE.
WHALESWAP TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE USE OF THE SERVICE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FAILED TRANSACTIONS, LOST FUNDS, OR MALICIOUS ACTIVITY BY THIRD PARTIES.

**4.2 Indemnification**
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the WhaleSwap developers, contributors, and community members from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt arising from: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including intellectual property rights; or (d) your violation of any applicable law or regulation.

**5. Intellectual Property**
WhaleSwap is open-source software. The code is made available under the relevant open-source license (e.g., MIT). While you are free to view, copy, and modify the code for your own use, you may not use the "WhaleSwap" name, logo, or trademarks to imply endorsement or confuse users without permission.

**6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

**6.1 No Specific Jurisdiction**
Because WhaleSwap is a decentralized, open-source protocol not based in any specific country, it is not subject to the laws of any single nation. However, in the event that a dispute arises and legal action is taken despite the decentralized nature of the project, you agree that the laws of a neutral jurisdiction (to be determined by the consensus of the community or the location of the defendant) may apply.

**6.2 Dispute Resolution**
Any disputes relating to the Service or this Agreement shall be resolved amicably by the community. Because WhaleSwap is not a legal entity, it cannot be sued in a court of law. Any liability is limited to the extent of the assets held in the smart contracts, and there is no corporate entity to pursue for damages. You waive your right to participate in class action lawsuits against WhaleSwap contributors or developers.

**7. Modifications**
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time by posting the updated terms on the website. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

**8. General Provisions**
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and WhaleSwap regarding your use of the Service.
